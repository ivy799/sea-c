# Fix: "No active pause found for this subscription" Error

## Problem Description
Users were unable to resume paused subscriptions, receiving the error: "No active pause found for this subscription"

## Root Cause Analysis
From the query logs, we can see that the API was looking for pause records with `end_date is null`, but the logic was too restrictive and didn't handle all cases properly.

## Key Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Resume API Logic Too Restrictive**
**Before**: The resume API only looked for pause records with `end_date is null`
```sql
-- Old query was too restrictive
select * from "paused_subscriptions" 
where ("subscription_id" = $1 and "end_date" is null)
```

**After**: Now it looks for any pause record for the subscription
```sql
-- New query is more flexible
select * from "paused_subscriptions" 
where "subscription_id" = $1 
order by "id" 
limit 1
```

### 2. **Graceful Handling of Missing Pause Records**
**Problem**: If a subscription was paused but no pause record existed, the resume would fail

**Solution**: If no pause record is found but subscription status is 'paused', we now:
1. Create a pause record for consistency
2. Immediately end it to complete the resume operation

### 3. **Simplified Pause Status Detection**
**Before**: Complex logic checking dates and multiple conditions
**After**: Simple check - if subscription.status === 'paused', then it's paused

## Code Changes:

### File: `src/app/api/subscriptions/[id]/pause/route.ts`
```typescript
// Added more flexible pause record search
const pauseRecords = await db
  .select()
  .from(pausedSubscriptionsTable)
  .where(
    eq(pausedSubscriptionsTable.subscription_id, subscriptionId)
  )
  .orderBy(pausedSubscriptionsTable.id)
  .limit(1);

// Handle missing pause records gracefully
if (pauseRecords.length === 0) {
  // Create and immediately end a pause record for consistency
  const pauseRecord = await db.insert(pausedSubscriptionsTable).values({
    subscription_id: subscriptionId,
    start_date: today,
    end_date: null
  }).returning();
  
  await db
    .update(pausedSubscriptionsTable)
    .set({ end_date: today })
    .where(eq(pausedSubscriptionsTable.id, pauseRecord[0].id));
}
```

### File: `src/app/api/subscriptions/my-subscriptions/route.ts`
```typescript
// Simplified pause detection
const isPaused = subscription.status === 'paused';
```

## Debug Logging Added:
- Log subscription status when attempting resume
- Log number of pause records found
- Log pause record details
- Log each step of the resume process

## Testing Steps:
1. **Pause a subscription** - should work as before
2. **Check subscription list** - should show "Paused" status with Resume button
3. **Click Resume** - should now work without "No active pause found" error
4. **Verify status** - subscription should return to "Active" status

## Expected Behavior After Fix:
✅ Resume button appears for paused subscriptions  
✅ Resume operation completes successfully  
✅ Subscription status updates from "paused" to "active"  
✅ UI refreshes to show active subscription controls  
✅ Works even if pause record is missing (data consistency issue)

## Monitoring:
- Check server logs for debug messages starting with `[RESUME]`
- Verify database consistency after pause/resume operations
- Monitor for any remaining edge cases
